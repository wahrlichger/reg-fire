# Linear Regression Analysis of Forest Fire Area

This repository contains the implementation and results of a linear regression analysis of forest fire areas in relation to three key environmental variables: temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The data, compiled into a comprehensive dataset, were analyzed using MATLABâ€™s linear regression function. The aim is to identify the relationships between these environmental factors and the size of forest fire areas.

## Data

We have a comprehensive dataset of forest fires which includes measurements of environmental factors. Dataset comprises measurements of temperature (temp), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (wind), and the size of the area affected by the fire (area). We cleaned the dataset to remove missing data. The total number of observations after cleaning is 517.

## Methodology

To analyze the data, we used a linear regression model. In this case, the area affected by the forest fire is the dependent variable, while temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed serve as the independent variables.
